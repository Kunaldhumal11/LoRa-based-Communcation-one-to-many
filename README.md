# Lora-Based-communication-with-different-devices



This project demonstrates LoRa communication between a single transmitter and multiple receivers. The system uses ESP8266 and LoRa modules to control devices remotely. The transmitter sends commands to specific devices, which then perform corresponding actions.

‚ú® Features

One-to-many communication: Control multiple devices using a single transmitter.
LoRa technology: Long-range, low-power communication.
Device-specific control: Send commands to individual devices based on their IDs.
Real-time responses: Immediate activation of devices upon receiving commands.

üõ†Ô∏è Components

Transmitter:
LoRa module (SX1278)
ESP8266 (NodeMCU or D1 Mini)

Receiver (x10):
LoRa module (SX1278)
Arduino Uno 
ESP8266 
RGB LED (controlled based on received commands)
Arduino Uno (Optional)
üîß Setup Instructions
Wiring:

Connect the LoRa module to the ESP8266 at Transmitter :
LoRa Pin	ESP8266MOD Pin (D#)	GPIO
VCC	3.3V	-
GND	GND	-
SCK	D5	GPIO14
MISO	D6	GPIO12
MOSI	D7	GPIO13
NSS (SS)	D1	GPIO5
RST	D2	GPIO4
DIO0	D0	GPIO16

Transmitter Code:

Upload the transmitter.ino file to the ESP8266 at the transmitter side.
Modify the code to include the device IDs and corresponding commands.

Connect the LoRa module to the Arduino Uno :
VCC	3.3V	Power Supply (3.3V)
GND	GND	Ground
SCK	13	SPI Clock
MISO	12	SPI Master In Slave Out
MOSI	11	SPI Master Out Slave In
NSS (SS)	10	SPI Slave Select (Chip Select)
RST	9	Reset Pin
DIO0	2	Interrupt¬†Pin

Receiver Code:

Upload the receiver.ino file to each ESP8266 receiver.
Ensure each device has a unique ID to differentiate it.
Command Format:

Send commands in the format:
DEVICE_ID COLOR
Example: DEVICE1 RED

üí° How It Works
The transmitter sends commands using LoRa protocol.
Receivers listen for commands and match their ID.
On receiving a matching command, the device activates its RGB LED to the specified color.

üìã Requirements

Software:
Arduino IDE
LoRa libraries (LoRa.h, SoftwareSerial.h)

Hardware:
ESP8266 modules
LoRa modules
RGB LEDs
